# manjaroRice
My rice on Manjaro i3

The color theme on vscode is Box UK Contrast from the rainglow extension.
Wallpapers are by RaidyHD, I found them on wallhaven.
Started with a polybar from github.com/AnubisZ9 I didn't change much, just added temp and changed some colors.
Fonts for the bar can be found at https://aur.archlinux.org/nerd-fonts-terminus.git
